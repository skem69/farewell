            <p>Oh snickers, my favourite moderation doggo and an extremely good friend. I've enjoyed the conversations we've had, even if they've been short you've always been there.</p>

            <h2 id="anthony">Anthony;</h2>
            <p>Ant, where do I start. We've shared some fun moments together, whether that be while moderating, on-duty as DHS or playing that boring blackhawk game, you have always been there for me and I'm extremely grateful for you.</p>
    
            <h2 id="cz">Czech;</h2>
            <p>My favourite Czech spy, Czechspy_tf2! I hope your life is going well, I remember when we were both little MIT's and completed our buddy training, I wish you the best in your moderation venture.</p>
    
            <h2 id="jet">Jetfly;</h2>
            <p>Oh jetfly.. one of my favourite P*T*SD members, we've had some good times in Hardline and I wish you the best.</p>

            <h2 id="lama">Lama;</h2>
            <p>Oh lama lama lama.. I've enjoyed the times we've moderated together (and the times I've rickrolled you >:) I wish you the best and hope you continue to help Hardline thrive!</p>

            <h2 id="half">Halfie;</h2>
            <p>Halfie.. You were my rock when I was an MIT, and I apologise for all of those questions I bombarded you with but you helped me become the amazing moderator I was today!</p>

            <h2 id="dima">Dima;</h2>
            <p>We haven't shared many conversations, but you're a cool ass dude.</p>

            <h2 id="ipad">Ipad;</h2>
            <p>YOU'RE ALSO A COOL ASS DUDE AND I WISH YOU THE VERY BEST MY FRIEND!!!</p>

            <p id="farewell">To anybody that I have missed, I apologise. <br> I hope we can keep in-touch as I'll be sticking around, just not in the staff team. I love you all so much, you all have an extremely special place in my heart and I wish you all the best.</p>
